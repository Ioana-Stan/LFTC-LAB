Symbol Table using a Hash Table

For my Symbol Table I chose to implement a Hash table for the elements stored in the table.

def hash (element):
- the hash function gets the element and creates its hashcode: the sum of each character in the ascii table modulo capacity.
Arguments:
    element: string/integer
Returns:
    the hash code corresponding to the provided element

def add (element):
-the add function adds the element to the table on its hashed position. If the element was already added, the position is returned.
Arguments:
    element: string/integer
Returns:
    the position, in the table, of the element that was found, if the element was already in the list
    the position, in the table, the element was added on, otherwise

def get (element):
-the get function returns the position of the element in the hash table.
Arguments:
    element: string/integer
Returns:
    the position of the provided element inthe table
